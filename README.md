# Wi-Fi Connection Card Generator

The Wi-Fi Connection Card Generator is an app that generates Wi-Fi connection
cards based on a template of your choice. It embeds a QR codes in the generated
card that makes it easy to join a Wi-Fi network. 

Optionally, the generated card can be used as a cover for a credit-card sized
NFC card with Wi-Fi network information recorded onto it. With that set up, 
a device can join a Wi-Fi network by either scanning the QR code or by tapping
the NFC card. (NFC functionality not provided by this project).

## Examples

Here are some examples of cards generated by the generator:

![Card 1](./images/card.svg)
![Card 2 - Black](./images/card2-black.svg)
![Card 2 - White](./images/card2-white.svg)
![Card 3](./images/card3.svg)

## Usage

After cloning the project, activate the Python virtual environment and install 
the dependencies.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/brunokc/wifi-conn-card-gen.git
[...]
$ cd wifi-conn-card-gen
$ . venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that, you can generate cards by running `generate-card.py` and specifying 
your network credentials and which template you'd like to use:

```shell
(venv) $ generate-card.py -t card-template.svg "My WiFi Network" "my_wifi_p@ssw0rd" -o card.svg
```

After that, you can print your card (card.svg in the example above) and show it
to your friends or guests when they need to connect to your Wi-Fi network.
